# Flash Programming Instructions

1. Add CrossCore Embedded Studio to your Windows PATH (e.g. `C:\Analog Devices\CrossCore Embedded Studio 2.8.0`) so that the `elfloader` utility can be invoked.

2. Append a `.exe` extension to the end of the Core-0 (ARM) executable

3. Copy your `.dxe` and `.exe` files into the `sam_Input_DXE_Files` directory

4. From a command prompt run the `prog_sam_flash` command with the root name of your DXE/EXE files as the argument.
